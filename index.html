				<h2>What is Go?</h2>
				<p>
					Go is an <b>open source</b> programming language.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s <b>statically typed</b> and produces <b>compiled</b> machine code binaries.</p>
				</p>
				<aside class="notes">

				<h2>Co-authors</h2>
				<p class="italic">
					It was designed at Google by <b>Robert Griesemer</b>, <b>Rob Pike</b>, and <b>Ken Thompson</b>.

					<ul>
						<li>Robert Griesemer: <br />Robert Griesemer is a Swiss computer scientist. He is best known for
							his work on the Go programming language. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming
							language. Prior to Go, He worked on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the Sawzall language, the
							Java HotSpot virtual machine, and the Strongtalk system.</li>
						<li>Rob Pike: <br />Robert "Rob" C. Pike is a Canadian programmer and author. He is best known
							for his work on the Go programming language and at Bell Labs, where he was a member of the
							Unix team and was involved in the creation of the Plan 9 from Bell Labs and Inferno
							operating systems, as well as the Limbo programming language.</li>
						<li>Ken Thompson: <br />Kenneth Lane Thompson is an American pioneer of computer science.
							Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and implemented the
							original Unix operating system.</li>

				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>The computing landscape today is almost unrelated to the environment in which the languages being
					used, mostly C++, Java, and Python, had been created.</p>
				<p>
					Modern landscape = multicore processors, networked systems, massive computation clusters, larger
					scale...

						The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively communicate ideas.

					<ul>
						<li>Code is read more than it is written. As developers, we are story-tellers and novel
							writters. We need to do a good job at that and if the language enables it, all the better.
						</li>
						<li>We needed a language that would be easy to read and reason about.</li>
						<li>The intention of the developer should be easily deduced by glancing at the code.</li>
						<li>The first step towards writing maintainable code is making sure intent of the code is clear.

				<h2>Simplicity</h2>

					<p>aka "Does it spark joy?"</p>

					<ul>
						<li>We’ve all been in a situation where we say “I can’t understand this code”. We’ve all worked
							on programs we were scared to make a change because we worried that it’ll break another part
							of the program; a part you don’t understand and don’t know how to fix. </li>
						<li>Clarity and simplicity are interlocking forces that lead to maintainable software.</li>

				<h2>Productivity</h2>

						“I started another compilation, turned my chair around to face Robert, and started asking
						pointed
						questions. Before the compilation was done, we’d roped Ken in and had decided to do something.”
					</blockquote>
					<small>Rob Pike</small>
					<ul>
						<li>How much time are we losing waiting for our tools or lost in a foreign codebase?</li>
						<li>Waiting or idle time breaks the flow and makes us lose focus.</li>
						<li>As a developer, Go allows us to quickly iterate quickly and feel productive</li>
						<li>Example: if you execute `go run` you'd think Go is interpreting the source code, due to the
							speed, but it's compiling it in fact.</li>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>On the same topic as productivity, we did not want to waste time of futile quarrel over
							formatting</li>
						<li>Go provides a great tool to handle that for us and everyone uses it.</li>

					<h2>Performance</h2>

							I/O Performance: Node vs. PHP vs. Java vs. Go</a></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>This is a "floor is lava" topic.</li>
							<li>Go is extremely fast. Comparing it to PHP or Node or Java is not a fair comparison (i.e
								compiled vs interpreted/JIT) in
								many cases.</li>
							<li>But you are free to read and experiment on your own ;)</li>
							<li>In many of my microservices, I see performance as being key.
							</li>
							<li>Even under what could be considered heavy load, the Go service responsible to feed
								events in RabbitMQ is
								way underload: same for worker service. The core services have been benchmarked to
								handle extremely more
								requests.
							</li>
							<li>In effect, we haven't had a need yet to vertically or horizontally scale any of our
								services.</li>

					<h2>Memory footprint</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Go is very lightweight both in terms of disk and memory space. speaking less than
								50-100mb
							</li>
							<li>You can fit a lot of Go applications in a single server.</li>
							<li>A big cost-saving considering that on a larger scale this can help turns 10-30 servers
								into 2-3 servers (real stories about that)</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Someone or something has to do the dirty work. In languages like C, you did the dirty
								work. This time of managing memory could be used to do more useful work.</li>
							<li>I guess we are all familar with the "The Billion Dollar Mistake"</li>
							<li>The Go garbage collector does a fantastic job of cleaning behind us without having to
								worry about working with messy pointers and possibly causing memory corruptions.</li>
							<li>The Go GC sports a great GC algorithm and runs amazingly fast causing no penalty cost in
								99% of time.

							<li>This is a no brainer. The more the merrier!</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Do you remember the pain of having to distribute a project and ended up caring more
								about the
								dependencies and tooling than the project itself?</li>
							<li>Distributing an application in Go is relatively effortless to the above: a single binary

					<h2>Concurrency</h2>

						<blockquote cite="Rob Pike">
							“Concurrency is not parallelism”
						</blockquote>
						<small>Rob Pike</small>
						<ul>
							<li>A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at
								the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions
								executing simultaneously.</li>
							<li>In other words, Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is
								about doing lots of things at once.</li>
							<li>Concurrency allows me to structure my services in such a way that they can deal
								with many tasks at once and if possible, do them in parallel.</li>
							<li>For instance, the service responsible for feeding the RabbitMQ with events, deal with
								each event concurrently.</li>
							<li>Go provides two concurrency primitives: Goroutines and Channels</li>
							<li>A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Go routines have very
								little overhead and you can spin thousands or millions of them.</li>
							<li>Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values. A way of
								communicating across go routines.</li>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Go has built-in support for testing and debugging!</li>
						<li>This is important to us as we are running microservices and these have its own sets of
							challenges compared to monoliths. We must be confident that these
							microservices are doing their jobs well. So automated testing is a top priority.</li>
						<li>This confidence highly reduces the stress when maintaining these services because in
							essence, those tests locks the behaviour of the services ensuring we are not breaking our

						<li>Go is really fast but does not mean you can't speed things up even more if required.
						</li>
						<li>As a reminder, the Go compiler is already optimizing our source code.</li>
